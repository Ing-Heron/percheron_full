[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsrcl_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "srcl_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "srcl_interfaces"
  with any of the following names:

    srcl_interfacesConfig.cmake
    srcl_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "srcl_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "srcl_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "srcl_interfaces" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
